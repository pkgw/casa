casa-python
===========

This is a fork of the official Python bridge for
[CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/), a software package for working with radio
interferometric data.

Its goal is to hew close to the official bridge, but it adds support for
PythonÂ 3.

This package of course builds on the extensive investment in CASA by the US
[National Radio Astronomical Observatory](https://www.nrao.edu/) and its
software development team.
