A set of functions for manipulating spw:chan selection strings.

several unit tests from the doc strings, including the one below:

Example:

    Given an spw:chan selection string, return what it should be after the spws
    have been remapped (i.e. by split), and a map from input to output spws
    (spwmap).  It does not change spw OR the *channels* part of the output spw
    string!  (See update_spwchan)

    If given, spwmap will be used as a dictionary from (string) input spw to
    (string) output spws.  Otherwise it will be freshly calculated.  Supplying
    spwmap doesn't just save work: it is also necessary for chaining
    update_spw() calls when the first selection includes more spws than the
    subsequent one(s).  HOWEVER, if given, spwmap must have slots for all the
    spws that will appear in the output MS, i.e. it can't be grown once made.
