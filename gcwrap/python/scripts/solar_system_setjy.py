# python functions to return expected flux density from solar system
# bodies.  the flux density depends on the geometry (distance, size of
# body, subearth latitude), and on the model brightness temperature.
# uncertainties on the flux density can also be returned, but are all
# set to 0.0 for now, because i don't have uncertainties on the model
# brightness temperatures.
#
# the model brightness temperatures for the various bodies are taken
# from a combination of modern models and historical observations.  see
# the written description for a more complete description of the model
# for each body.
#
# for all of the bodies but Mars, the model is contained in a text file
# that has tabulated brightness temperature as a function of frequency.
# for Mars it is also a function of time.  eventually, the full-up
# model calculations should be in the code (for those bodies that have
# proper models) but for now, just live with the tabulated versions.
