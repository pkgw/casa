          benchmark(listvis, (vis,), 7).  (When benchmarking interactive cases
          like that, just hit the keys when required.)

    nreps: should be a small integer > 1 to combat random error from other
           processes on the system (you probably want the minimum time).

    nperrep: integer >= 1 used to improve the timing precision on fast
             funcs, i.e. nperrep times will be added and then divided by nperrep.
